        Instagram[a] is a <a href="second.html">photo</a> and
        <a href="third.html">video sharing social networking service</a> owned
        by Meta Platforms. It allows users to upload media that can be edited
        with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a
        location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with
        preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and
        locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to
        add their content to a personal feed.[8] A Meta-operated image-centric
        social media platform, it is available on iOS, Android, Windows 10, and
        the web. Users can take photos and edit them using built-in filters and
        other tools, then share them on other social media platforms like
        Facebook. It supports 32 languages including English, Spanish, French,
        Korean, and Japanese

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in
        app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom
        closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) seed funding round
        with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on
        Burbn.[10][11] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they
        refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature
        among its users.[12][13] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of
        instant camera and telegram

      <h3>2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding</h3>
      <p>
        The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38,
        posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 p.m. on July 16, 2010.[17][13] On October
        6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App
        Store. In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7
        million (equivalent to $9,357,057 in 2023) in Series A funding from a
        variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris
        Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[18] The deal valued
        Instagram at around $20 million. In April 2012, Instagram raised $50
        million (equivalent to $65,610,000 in 2023) from venture capitalists
        with a valuation of $500 million (equivalent to $656,100,000 in
        2023).[19] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's
        Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital,
        to double its money after the sale to Facebook

      <h4>2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app</h4>
      <p>
        In June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to
        become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each
        photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile
        website.[40][41][42] Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three
        instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The slideshow
        banner[43][44] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously
        slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user,
        alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In
        addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.
