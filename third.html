    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      Online video platforms can use a software as a service (SaaS) business
      model, a do it yourself (DIY) model or user-generated content (UGC) model.
      The OVP comes with an end-to-end tool set to upload, encode, manage,
      playback, style, deliver, distribute, download, publish and measure
      quality of service or audience engagement quality of experience of online
      video content for both video on demand (VOD) and live delivery. This is
      usually manifested as a User Interface with log-in credentials. OVPs also
      include providing a custom video player or a third-party video player that
      can be embedded in a website. Modern online video platforms are often
      coupled up with embedded online video analytics providing video publishers
      with detailed insights into video performance: the total number of video
      views, impressions, and unique views; video watch time, stats on user
      location, visits, and behavior on the site. Video heat maps show how user
      engagement rate changes through the viewing process in order to measure
      audience interaction and to create compelling video content. OVPs are
      related to the over-the-top content video industry, although there are
      many OVP providers that are also present in broadcast markets, serving
      video on demand set-top boxes
