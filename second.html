      Image sharing, or photo sharing, is the publishing or transfer of digital
      photos online. Image sharing websites offer services such as uploading,
      hosting, managing and sharing of photos (publicly or privately).[1] This
      function is provided through both websites and applications that
      facilitate the upload and display of images. The term can also be loosely
      applied to the use of online photo galleries that are set up and managed
      by individual users, including photoblogs. Sharing means that other users
      can view but not necessarily download images, and users can select
      different copyright options for their images.
